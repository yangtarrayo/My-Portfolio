                  <p>
                    I love gardening because it makes me feel connected to nature. 
                    Planting seeds, watching them grow, and caring for plants gives 
                    me a sense of peace and satisfaction. It's like creating a little
                     piece of beauty in the world, and I find it incredibly rewarding.
                      And the best part is gardening allows me to grow my own fruits, 
                    vegetables, and herbs, which can help to a healthier diet.

                     myself without words, just through movements. It's like telling a story with my body. 
                     Dancing helps me feel free and relaxed, and it's a great way to forget about any worries 
                     or stress and it makes me confident and happy.
